----- Week 3 Assignemnt 2 -------

Assignment Instructions:

You can access the simulator by going to this link:
pknessness.github.io/pid_sim/pid.html

The simulator has a slider for "Example Presets" the first three are 
part1, part2, and part3, of this assignment, the next 3 are examples 
from the video lecture, which you can play around with and observe the 
tunings of.

You don't need to use all the parameters given to tune the targets, but 
all are given incase you need them.

Part 1: Position
 
Objectives
  - Stabilize the system in 5 seconds with overshoot of less than 3. 
  - Record your PID settings

Part 2: Flywheels

Objectives
  - Stabilize the Flyweels in 2.5 seconds with overshoot of less than 5. 
  - Record your PID settings
