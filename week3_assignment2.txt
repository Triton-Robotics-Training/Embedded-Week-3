----- Week 3 Assignemnt 2 -------

Assignment Instructions:

You can access the simulator by going to this link:
pknessness.github.io/pid_sim/pid.html

The simulator has a slider for "Example Presets" the first three are 
part1, part2, and part3, of this assignment, the next 3 are examples 
from the video lecture, which you can play around with and observe the 
tunings of.

You don't need to use all the parameters given to tune the targets, but 
all are given incase you need them.

Tuning PID:

Before pressing the "Test Sequence" button, you can tune your PID values 
for each part by changing the Setpoint slider to a different point and 
seeing how the actual position tries to keep up.

You want to start by tuning Kp (proportional gain) till the actual output 
is oscillating around the desired output but not overshooting heavily.

Then, you can tune the Kd (derivative gain) such that the actual output 
settles reasonably quickly around the desired point.

Finally, you can tune the Ki (integral gain) to remove any steady state 
error/offset that your actual position has from the desired position. 
Remember to keep your Ki low, and set a reasonable Icap as well!

(For part 3)

After this, if your system is still not settling accurately, you can 
add code to the feedforward equation. The feedforward will remove any 
predictable errors (such as the ones caused by friction) onto the 
system by directly adding a term from the state variable to the output.

It would then be of the form:

return -45 * Math.cos(actual * Math.PI / 180);
